                    <h2>KAI VENICE</h2>
                    <p>
                        Kai Venice is an Italian young singer. His inspirations come from more artists in the industry of music.
                        His name contains the city Venice, which he really loves and goes often due to family, and the name Kai was
                        taken by himself because he liked the name personally. Today Kai works with Bandlab to produce vocals into
                        instrumentals and created his own community to collaborate and feature with more producers.
                    </p>
                    <h2>HOW DID IT START?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Kai always had a passion for music, even when he was a kid. He liked Pop and Alternative songs, but
                        didn't really know it. At the age of 10, he started to follow a really great artist in the industry of
                        music. That artist opened a world for him, and he started to follow more artists and listen to more
                        genres. At the age of 13, he made a decision; he wanted to start making his own music, where he only
                        covered songs from different artists. Unfortunately, all the copies are unreleased and went missing,
                        except one: Cut my Hair (Cover).
